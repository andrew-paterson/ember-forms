      <p>This is the development sandbox for an Ember component which aims to abstract all of the functional aspects of webforms into boilerplate code, and allow forms to be created with plain JavaScript objects.</p>
      <p>The functional code is located primarily in two components</p>
      <p>The first is <b>components/extensible/validating-form-field</b>, which provides the code for generating the template wrapper for individual fields, as well as handling the field validation.</p>
      <p>The second is <b>components/blocks/generic/validating-form</b>, which provides the code for generating the template wrapper for form as a whole, and initiates the validation of all fields when the form is submitted.</p>
      <p>Examples of a JavaScript object that can be passed into the <b>validating-form</b> component can be found in services/session.js.<b>components/forms/signup-form.js</b> and <b>components/forms/edit-account-form.js</b></p>
      <h2>Tests</h2>
      <p>Tests can be run by visiting http://localhost:4200/tests, assuming the app is running on port 4200. There are several linting errors which show up in the tests. These are auto-generated. If you would like to run only the tests that I have written, please check disabled linting.</p>
